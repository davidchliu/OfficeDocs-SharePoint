# Change a specific user's OneDrive storage space

As a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365, you can set the OneDrive storage space for a specific user.
  
> [!NOTE]
> For info about setting the default storage space, see [Set the default storage space for OneDrive users](set-default-storage-space.md). For info about the storage available for your Microsoft 365 subscription, see the [OneDrive service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/onedrive-for-business-service-description).

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization is configured for multi-geo, you need to use PowerShell to change a user's OneDrive storage space. Editing storage limits isn't available in the Microsoft 365 admin center.  

## Change a user's storage space in the Microsoft 365 admin center

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Microsoft 365 admin permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.
    
2. In the left pane, select **Users** \> **Active users**.

3. Select the user.

4. Select the **OneDrive** tab.

5. Under **Storage used** click **Edit**.

6. Select the **Maximum storage for this user** option, and type the storage limit that you want to use.

7. Click **Save**.

When you need cloud storage for individual users beyond the initial 5 TB, additional cloud storage will be granted as follows:

When a user has filled their 5 TB of OneDrive storage to at least 90% capacity, Microsoft will increase your default storage space in OneDrive to up to 25 TB per user (admins may set a lower per-user limit if they want to).

For any user that reaches at least 90% capacity of their 25 TB of OneDrive storage, additional cloud storage will be provided as 25 TB SharePoint team sites to individual users. Contact Microsoft technical support for information and assistance.

Admins can [open a case with Microsoft technical support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869559) to request storage beyond 5 TB.
    
    
## Change a user's storage space by using PowerShell

1. [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall "SharePoint Online Management Shell."
	> 
	> On the Download Center page, select your language and then click the Download button. You'll be asked to choose between downloading a x64 and x86 .msi file. Download the x64 file if you're running the 64-bit version of Windows or the x86 file if you're running the 32-bit version. If you don't know, see [Which version of Windows operating system am I running?](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system). After the file downloads, run it and follow the steps in the Setup Wizard.

2. Save the following script as a PowerShell file. For example, you could save it to a file named UpdateOneDriveStorage.ps1.
    
    ```PowerShell
    $TenantUrl = Read-Host "Enter the SharePoint admin center URL" 
    Connect-SPOService -Url $TenantUrl 
 
    $OneDriveSite = Read-Host "Enter the OneDrive Site URL" 
    $OneDriveStorageQuota = Read-Host "Enter the OneDrive Storage Quota in MB" 
    $OneDriveStorageQuotaWarningLevel = Read-Host "Enter the OneDrive Storage Quota Warning Level in MB" 
    Set-SPOSite -Identity $OneDriveSite -StorageQuota $OneDriveStorageQuota -StorageQuotaWarningLevel $OneDriveStorageQuotaWarningLevel 
    Write-Host "Done" 
    ```

3. Open the SharePoint Online Management Shell. Run the script in the location you saved it.

    ```PowerShell
    PS C:\>.\ UpdateOneDriveStorage.ps1
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you get an error message about being unable to run scripts, you might need to change your execution policies. For more info about PowerShell execution policies, see [About Execution Policies](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.1&preserve-view=true).
    
4. When prompted, enter the SharePoint admin center URL. For example, "https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com" is the Contoso SharePoint admin center URL.

5. Sign in as a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365.

6. Enter the OneDrive site URL: For example, https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/user_contoso_onmicrosoft_com.

7. Enter the OneDrive Storage Quota in MB.

8. Enter the OneDrive Storage Quota Warning Level in MB.

   | MB  | TB |
   | ------------- | ------------- |
   | 1024000  | 1  |
   | 2048000 | 2  |
   | 3072000  | 3  |
   | 4096000 | 4 |
   | 5120000 | 5 |
   | 6144000 | 6 |
   | 7168000 | 7 |
   | 8192000 | 8 |
   | 9216000 | 9 |
   | 10240000 | 10 |

> [!NOTE]
> To change the storage space for multiple users, use PowerShell to [Display a list of OneDrive accounts by using PowerShell](list-onedrive-urls.md) and use [Set-SPOSite](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps&preserve-view=true) to make the change.
> 
> To disable OneDrive creation for specific users, see [Manage user profiles in the SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/manage-user-profiles).
